HE/SHE DID NOT MAKE ANY TIME FOR ME AND WHEN I ASKED FOR ANALGESIA HE/SHE SAID BACK TO ME "" YOU ARE NOT HAVING ANYMORE, YOU HAVE HAD ENOUGH FOR THIS WHOLE ROOM""  I THOUGHT THIS WAS DISGUSTING AS I KNOW I HAD BREAK THROUGH MEDICATION PRESCRIBED AND I WAS IN ALOT OF PAIN. THIS SAME NURSE WAS ALSO GOING IN AND OUT OF EACH BAY WITH NOT USING THE PROVIDED HAND RUB. AT AROUND 1900 HOURS I ASKED THE SAME NURSE IF I WAS ABLE TO GO TO THE PT KITCHEN TO MAKE A COFFEE AND HE/SHE TURNED ME AND SAID WE DONT HAVE ONE AND THAT I WAS NOT ALOUD TO HAVE COFFEE AT THIS HOUR OF THE NIGHT. I THEN WAS TOLD BY ANOTHER PT THAT THERE WAS A KITCHEN.  I DONT LIKE TO COMPLAIN AS I AM A XXXX MYSELF AND I KNOW HOW HARD THE JOB IS, THOUGH I AM SORRY THIS WAS WAY BELOW STANDARDS.

THEY ALL KNEW WHAT CARE WAS BEST FOR ME AND INCLUDED ME IN ALL CARE DECISIONS WHERE APPROPRIATE.,"THE LOCUM MEDICAL STAFF IN EMERGENCY DID NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THE REFERRAL FROM THE HOSPITAL THAT SENT ME TO  XXXX HOSPITAL. THE LOCUM MEDICAL STAFF NEED TO BE EDUCATED MORE ABOUT THE EXPERTISE AND QUALIFICATIONS OF THE STAFF IN SMALLER HOSPITALS THAT REFER PATIENTS TO XXXX HOSPITAL SO THE CARE CAN BE MORE EFFICIENT AND SAFER FOR THE PATIENT. THE SMALLER HOSPITALS HAVE LESS TECHNICAL EQUIPMENT TO MAKE THEIR DIAGNOSIS, BUT TAKING INTO CONSIDER MY HISTORY (BECAUSE THEY KNEW ME) AND MY CLINICAL INFORMATION, THEY RECOMMENDED I GO TO XXXX FOR SURGERY AND THEY WERE 100% RIGHT. WHEN I ARRIVED AT XXXX, THE EMERGENCY MEDICAL LOCUM WAS DOUBTING THE CLINICAL REFERRAL THAT I HAD BEEN SENT WITH, WHICH THEN SEEMED TO DELAY HIS/HER INVESTIGATION PROCESS TO CONFIRM I NEEDED AN OPERATION.

ONCE THE DOCTORS WERE TALKING TO ME, THE OTHER TIME I WAS ONE OF XXXX PATIENTS WHO WERE NOT BEING CONSULTED BY ANYBODY. I BELIEVE THIS IS WRONG, HAVING ONCE BEEN A LEADING HAND IN THE KITCHEN I KNOW THAT THE DIET AIDS HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO CALL BACK OR AT LEAST ENTER A ROOM TO RECEIVE THE OTHER PATIENTS ORDERS. THEN THEY COULD COME BACK AND SEE THE PATIENT SEEN BY DOCTORS. IF THE DIET AID IS ON THE SAME ROUTINE DAILY, AS ARE THE DOCTORS,  THE SAME PATIENTS WOULD MISS OUT DAILY."

I FELT LIKE I WAS BEING 'TICKED AND FLICKED' BY THE PROFESSIONALS AND THAT NOBODY CARED ABOUT MY OVERALL HEALTH, I REACHED A POINT WHERE I WANTED TO GIVE UP & NOBODY WAS DOING ANYTHING USEFUL OTHER THAN GIVING SCRIPTS FOR NAUSEA. I JUST CONTINUED TO WHITHER AND FADE AWAY. IF MY VITAL SIGNS WERE MONITORED CORRECTLY MY CARDIAC ARREST COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED!","THE EMERGENCY AND TRIAGE SYSTEM NEED TO BE SERIOUSLY REVIEWED!

FILL THE VACANCIES AND GET MORE DOCTORS AND TRAINED STAFF, PRIORITISE EMERGENCY AND PUBLIC ACCESS, HOW MANY MORE PEOPLE HAVE TO DIE IN THE WAITING ROOM OR LIKE ME, HAVE A CARDIAC ARREST IN ICU AND FALL OUT OF THE BED IN THE PROCESS...WHY WASN'T I BEING MONITORED?

I DIDN'T GET ENOUGH REST AS IT WAS CONSTANTLY NOISY AND BUZZERS GOING OFF. POST SURGERY WITH A NEWBORN ALL I WANTED WAS REST. THE ONE MIDWIFE WHO I CAN COMPLAINED ABOUT DEFINITELY DIDN'T RESPECT MY SPACE AND CONSTANTLY CAME IN LOUD AND WITHOUT THE KNOCKING FOR MINOR QUESTIONS AND REASONS. I FOUND IT REALLY JARRING AND DISRESPECTFUL. IT WOULD BE BETTER IF THE NURSES ALSO TIMED THE OBSERVATIONS FOR BOTH ME AND MY BABY AT THE SAME TIME- ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT. IT WAS HOURLY OBS FOR BOTH OF US BUT BECAUSE WE WERE CARED FOR BY DIFFERENT TEAMS WE DIDN'T GET ANY REST. THAT'S WHY I LEFT EARLY AS IT WAS TOO DISRUPTIVE FOR ME AND MY BABY.

MY SUGGESTIONS ARE AS FOLLOWS. 1)   IF THE DOCTORS IN THE FRACTURE UNIT COULD PROVIDE DETAIL ABOUT THE PROGRESS OF MY FRACTURE THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL, AT LEAST I DIDN'T NEED TO WORRY. 2)  IF THE DOCTOR CAN ADVISE PATIENTS TO DO BONE DENSITY TEST ESPECIALLY FOR MEN/WOMEN WHO ARE XXXX XXXX AND HAVE FRACTURE.  THIS WOULD HELP IN DISCOVERING THE OSTEOPOROSIS AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE.  IN A WAY, THIS MAY HELP IN REDUCING PEOPLE ADMITTING HOSPITAL FOR BROKEN BONES AND CAN UTILISE RESOURCES FOR OTHER AREAS."

BUT LONGER THAN THAT SHOULD BE AVOIDED.,"IN THE RECOVERY WARD PATIENTS SHOULD BE ASKED TO KEEP THEIR VOICES DOWN WHILE ON THE PHONE OR WITH FAMILY ETC, AND TO HAVE SHORT CONVERSATIONS IF POSSIBLE. NOISE IS VERY UPSETTING IMMEDIATELY AFTER SURGERY IN A FAIRLY STRESSFUL ENVIRONMENT.

(THIS IS SAID FROM SOMEONE THAT SURVIVED SEXUAL VIOLENCE & ALL PAINKILLERS ACCIDENTALLY STOPPING 24HRS AFTER MAJOR SURGERY). I STILL SUFFER NIGHTMARES, HAD A WEEK OF HYSTERICAL CRYING & EMOTIONS I STILL DONT UNDERSTAND. FOR THE RECORD I HAVE XXXX XXXX XXXX CANCER, IM NOT 50/50 & THAT ISNT HOW IT WORKS ANYWAY. HE/SHE WAS BORED WITH ME, HE/SHE WAS DESPERATE TO GET OUT & I MUST HAVE BEEN IRRITATING. I HOPE HE/SHE EXPERIENCES ATLEAST ONCE HOW HE/SHE MADE ME FEEL. I TELL EVERY PERSON I KNOW & MEET, EVERY HEALTHCARE WORKER THATS TREATED ME, I SPEAK OF IT BECAUSE IT IS STILL THAT RAW. HE/SHE IS THE ONLY PERSON I TRULY HATE"

I AM NOT SURE WHAT RESULTS WERE GETTING DONE IN THE EMERGENCY AREA, THE FIRST DOCTOR DID NOT EXPLAIN THIS VERY WELL.  LUCKILY THE CHANGE OF SHIFT OCCURRED AND MY SON/DAUGHTER WAS THERE TO ASK THE 2ND EMERGENCY DOCTOR WHAT WAS HAPPENING.  THEY WERE VERY PROACTIVE, THEY SAID I AM NOT GOING ANYWHERE AND ORGANIZED A SCAN TO BE DONE IN THE HOSPITAL AND OTHER TESTS TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF MY SEVERE ABDOMINAL PAIN.  I THINK HANDOVERS SHOULD BE DONE BETTER AS WELL AS DOCTORS NEED TO FIND OUT RESULTS FIRST BEFORE DETERMINING WHETHER A PATIENT NEEDS TO GO HOME.

I FOUND THIS HIGHLY INAPPROPRIATE- AND STEPPED IN TO ADVOCATE FOR THE PATIENT WHO I KNEW WAS ALREADY HIGHLY ANXIOUS ABOUT HIS/HER GYNO OPERATION BUT I COULD TELL FELT NERVOUS ABOUT REFUSING. PERSONALLY I WAS APPALLED THAT THIS WAS EVEN SUGGESTED. THERE IS NO REASON FIR A XXXX TO DELAY A PATIENT IN SURGERY AND PRACTICE INTRAVAGINAL EXAMINATIONS. SURELY EXPECTING CONSENT FOR SUCH PENETRATION IS UNDER DURESS AS SOMEONE IS ABOUT TO GO UNDER (AND DRESSED IN VULNERABLE GOWNS). I ALSO FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT IT SHOULD BE DONE WHILE A PATIENT IS AWAKE AND ALERT TO POTENTIAL CHAFING - AND THE XXXX SHOULD BE LEARNING TO DO SUCH AN EXAMINATION WHILE A PATIENT CAN COMPLAIN OF PAIN SO THEY LEARN APPROPRIATELY. THIS FELT LIKE ASKING PERMISSION FIR A VIOLATION. THE PATIENT WAS SO GRATEFUL I GAVE HIM/HER THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THE CONFIDENCE TO REFUSE.

THE OTHER HOSPITALS I'VE BEEN IN XXXX X 2 XXXX X 4 XXXX X 1 XXXX X 1 XXXX X 1 XXXX X 4","NURSES ARE OVERWORKED, STILL THEY ARE EFFICIENT AND KEEP THEIR SENSE OF CARE AND HUMOUR. AS ALL HOSPITALS-UNDERSTAFF, LONG WAITS IN EMERGENCY. THE HOSPITAL IN ALL DOES ITS BEST. THE ONLY COMPLAINT IS ON MY DISCHARGE PAPERS IT IS DOWN THAT I'M AN OCCASIONAL DRINKER OF ALCOHOL.

CVBHMI, Carrot Hospital,50+,Man or male,Good,THEY SAVED MY LIFE,NIL
RTUITO, Taro Hospital,18-49,Woman or female,Very good,"THE BEST PART OF MY CARE WAS THAT THEY DONE EVERY TEST POSSIBLE  TO SCREEN FOR WHAT WAS GOING ON. EVEN THOUGHT THERE WAS NO DEFINITIVE ANSWERS AT THE TIME OF DISCUSSIONS,  THOSE TEST WERE SENT TO MY GP AND REVEALED THAT I WOULD NEED TO HAVE FURTHER SCREENING TO WORK OUT WHAT IS GOING ON.","I WAS MOVED AROUND XXXX TIMES IN XXXX DAYS. I SAT IN THW ED WAITING ROOM FOR MANY EXCESSIVE HOURS QHILE I WAITED FOR A BED. I WAS PLACED INTO AN OVERFLOW WARD THEN MOVED TO ANOTHER OVERFLOW WARD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. I WAS THEN MOVED INTO A REGULAR WARD AND PLACED IN A ROOM WITH 3 GENTLEMEN/LADIES FOR THE FINAL NIGHT IN HOSPITAL. THIS DID NOT WORRY ME IN THE SLIGHTEST AND I HAVE NO ISSUE WITH THIS AT ALL, HOWEVER THERE ISNT ENOUGH BATHROOMS AS THE FOUR BEDDED ROOM I WAS IN WAS ALSO SHARING A BATHROOM WITH ANOTHER FOUR BEDDED ROOM."
OPIUSD, Watermelon Hospital,18-49,Woman or female,Very good,"OVERALL, I WAS TREATED VERY WELL BY ALL DOCTORS AND NURSES IN ICU AND ON THE WARD. PARTICULARLY IN ICU WHEN I HAD MY CARDIAC ARREST, THE TEAM WORKED TOGETHER LIKE A WELL OILED MACHINE TO SAVE MY LIFE. I HAD FULL CONFIDENCE IN THE DOCTORS AND NURSES.","FIRSTLY, NEAR THE END OF MY ICU STAY BEFORE MOVING TO WARD, A FEW NURSES HAD TOO MANY PATIENTS ASSIGNED TO THEM, & LEFT ME SITTING/LAYING PAINFULLY WHEN I WAS IMMOBILE, WITHOUT CHECKING ON ME FOR SOME TIME WITHOUT MY BUZZER. SECOND, THE ICU PHYSIO CONTRADICTED WHAT THE HEAD DOCTOR IN ICU TOLD ME ABOUT HOW MUCH MOVEMENT I WAS ALLOWED, & THIS CAUSED ME SOME STRESS & PAIN. THIRD, AFTER HOURS DOCS IN THE WARD WERE NOT ALLOWED TO USE ULTRASOUND EQUIP & FAILED SEVERAL PAINFUL ATTEMPTS AT A CANULA INSERTION AND DRAWING BLOOD. LAST, MY DISCHARGE TIMING CAME AFTER BUSINESS HOURS & WITHOUT WARNING. MY DOCTOR ADVISED THAT I WOULD MOST LIKELY GO HOME ON THE XXXX, HOWEVER AFTER HE/SHE LEFT THAT XXXX EVENING, THE NURSE ARRIVED WITH MY DISCHARGE PAPERS & SAID IT WAS TIME TO GO - WITHOUT DISCUSSION WITH MY DOCTOR ABOUT LEAVING INSTRUCTIONS OR AFTER HOSPITAL CARE. SO THIS CAME AS A SHOCK AFTER BEING IN HOSPITAL FOR ALMOST XXXX XXXX, AND MY BLOOD LEVELS & TREATMENT STILL SLIGHTLY UNSTEADY AT THAT TIME."

I COULD NOT FAULT THE HOSPITAL AT ALL DURING THIS STAY.",THE ONLY FEEDBACK THAT I WILL SUGGEST IS POSSIBLY HAVING SOME MORE COMFORTABLE CHAIRS OR EXTRA CHAIRS/BEDS BEHIND ED.

I EXPRESSED THIS TO A NURSE WHEN HE/SHE GAVE ME PAIN RELIEF AND THAT I WOULD HAVE TO LAY ON THE FLOOR TO GET COMFORTABLE. THE NURSE WAS ONLY ABLE TO SUGGEST TO GO BACK INTO THE WAITING ROOM AGAIN.

THIS MAY BE POSSIBLE, BUT HAVING A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF MY CANCER DIAGNOSIS WOULD HAVE TAKEN AWAY A LOT OF ANXIETY. BY THE TIME I HAD MY APPOINTMENTS IT WAS WEEKS LATER. THERE ARE OTHER HOSPITALS THAT GIVE YOU ALL THE DETAILS VERY QUICKLY, E.G., XXXX  NURSE KNOWLEDGE OF MEDICATION NEEDS TO BE PASSED ON TO PATIENT.  I HAD CLEXANE AND WAS NOT TOLD TO NOT RUB THE INJECTION SITE, 3 MONTHS LATER I STILL HAVE BRUISES FROM THE SHOTS GIVEN IN HOSPITAL.

I CONTACTED MY /HUSBAND/WIFE TO BRING A TAKE AWAY MEAL FROM A TOWN CAFE TO THE HOSPITAL, OTHERWISE I WOULD NOT HAVE HAD A MEAL & HAD BEEN WAITING WITHOUT FOOD AT THE HOSPITAL SINCE MIDDAY. THE BREAKFAST OF 2 SLICES OF UNTOASTED WHITE BREAD, 2 X WEET BIX AND MILK WAS FURTHER PROOF OF POOR QUALITY NUTRITION. HOW CAN PATIENTS BE EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN HEALTH INCLUDING IMMUNICE CAPACITY WITH PROCESSED/PACKAGED FOOD COMPARED TO HAVING REASONABLY FRESH FOOD.

THIS WOULD HAVE MEANT THAT WHEN I WAS DISCHARGED, I DIDN'T HAVE ANY SUITABLE PAIN RELIEF FOR THE TRIP HOME. LUCKILY, THE NURSE AND DOCTOR WERE ABLE TO ORGANISE FOR ME TO BE GIVEN A SMALL AMOUNT OF THE PAINKILLERS THAT WOULD SUFFICE UNTIL I WAS ABLE TO SEE MY GP THE NEXT DAY. WITHOUT THIS INTERVENTION, I THINK I WOULD HAVE STRUGGLED TO MANAGE MY PAIN UPON DISCHARGE. I WOULD ALSO HAVE LIKED A BIT MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT 'CONSERVATIVE MANAGEMENT' OF MY INJURY MEANT. PERHAPS SOME WRITTEN INFORMATION THAT I COULD TAKE WITH ME UPON MY DISCHARGE WOULD BE HELPFUL. I WAS IN A LOT OF PAIN, AND PROBABLY A BIT OF SHOCK INITIALLY FORM THE INJURY, AND SO IT WAS HARD TO TAKE IN ALL THE INFORMATION VERBALLY. A BIT MORE DETAIL TO TAKE WITH ME WOULD HAVE BEEN HELPFUL."

I WAS ADMITTED TO XXXX AND TOLD THE DR WOULD MEET ME IN EMERGENCY. NO INFORMATION WAS GIVEN TO XXXX AND THE DOCTOR WAS NOT REACHABLE WHEN I ARRIVED. AFTER BEING ADMITTED I WAS LEFT FOR APPROX XXXX HOURS WAITING XXXX XXXX XXXX IN EMERGENCY FOR A PROCEDURE I WAS TOLD WAS URGENT AND NEEDED TO BE UNDERTAKEN ASAP OR I WOULD LOSE MY OVARY. THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AT XXXX CALLED THE OBSTETRIC TEAM AT XXXX REPEATEDLY ONLY TO FIND THAT THE NEW SHIFT CHANGE TEAM DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT ME OR HAVE ANY HAND OVER COMMUNICATION.A DOCTOR WAS SENT TO MEET ME IN EMERGENCY AND I ANSWERED PERSONAL QUESTIONS ABOUT MY SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HISTORY ON THE EMERGENCY WARD WITH ONLY THE CURTAIN FOR PRIVACY AND ALL OTHER PATIENTS BEING ABLE TO HEAR.
ARTBQW, Jackfruit Hospital,50+,Woman or female,Very good,"THE BEST PART OF THE CARE I RECEIVED WAS THE WAY I WAS TREATED BY ALL STAFF THAT CAME IN CONTACT WITH AT XXXX XXXX HOSPITAL. THE DOCTOR WERE VERY PROFESSIONAL IN ALL OF THE INTERVIEWS REGARDING MY HEALTH ISSUES. I WAS IMPRESSED THE WAY THE DOCTORS TOOK THE TROUBLE TO ENQUIRE ABOUT, NOT ONLY MY OWN MEDICAL HISTORY AND LIFESTYLE BUT MY RELEVANT FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY. THE NURSES WERE VERY CARING AND EFFICIENT AND ALWAYS TREATED ME WELL. IN FACT, ALL OF THE HOSPITAL STAFF WERE PLEASANT AND HELPFUL","IT BECAME GLARINGLY OBVIOUS TO ME THAT THE DOCTORS AND NURSES AT XXXX WERE GROSSLY OVERWORKED. IN SPITE OF THEIR UNREALISTIC WORKLOADS, THEY ALWAYS GAVE ME EXCELLENT PROFESSIONAL CARE. XXXX POPULATION HAS GROWN RAPIDLY AND CONTINUES TO GROW. AS A RESULT, MEDICAL STAFFING AT XXXX IS URGENTLY IN NEED OF A MAJOR UPGRADE. AS AN EXAMPLE, I WAS ADMITTED TO EMERGENCY FOR AN ULTRASOUND, BECAUSE OF MY GP'S CONCERN ABOUT INFLAMMATION IN MY XXXX BREAST. A CYST OR ABSCESS HAD THE POTENTIAL TO BURST AND RESULT IN LIFE-THREATENING SEPTICEMIA. HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF HEAVY PATIENT-LOAD IN EMERGENCY, I HAD TO SIT IN A CHAIR FOR XXXX HOURS WAITING AN ULTRASOUND. HAVING TO WAIT XXXX HOURS FOR AN ASSESSMENT OF A POTENTIALLY LIFE-THREATENING CONDITION COULD HAVE PROVED FATAL. FORTUNATELY, I HAD A GOOD OUTCOME"

KHZJDF, Kiwi Hospital,50+,Man or male,Neither good nor poor,I ENTERED HOSPITAL IN A GREAT DEAL OF PAIN AND AFTER XXXX DAYS I WAS OPERATED ON AND I LEFT XXXX DAYS AFTER MY ADMISSION FEELING BETTER NOT WELL BUT BETTER,THIS QUESTION IS A BIT UNFAIR AS THE HOSPITAL WAS ABOUT TO MOVE INTO A NEW ONE AND EVERYTHING WAS CHAOTIC. I WAS MOVED FROM ONE ROOM TO ANOTHER AS STAFF WERE GETTING MOVED AND WE HAD COVID LOCKDOWNS HAPPENING. I HAD ONE HEARING AID OUT OF ACTION AND I PROBABLY MISSED 2/3 OF MOST CONVERSATIONS EXCEPT WHEN MY WIFE WAS ALLOTS VISIT.

BECAUSE I AM TAKING FLUID TABLETS & WAS NOT PERMITTED TO GO TO TOILET I NEEDED REGULAR BED PANS - THIS ANNOYED THE XXXX NURSE & IN A BAD MOOD, HE/SHE PULLED THE PAN INPATIENTLY - WHICH SPILLED & REQUIRED A CHANGED OF BEDDING (2) I WAS TOLD I THINK ON THE XXXX DAY TO GET DRESSED AS I WAS GOING HOME. I SAT IN THE DEPARTURE ROOM, FROM ABOUT XXXXAM UNTIL LATE EVENING & SENT HOME IN A TAXI.

ARTBQW, Currant Hospital,50+,Man or male,Good,GOOD NURSES,
KHZJDF, Currant Hospital,50+,Woman or female,Good,INITIAL ADMISSION WAS SWIFT SO THAT HELP ALLEVIATE ANXIETY. MEDICAL AND NURSING STAFF DELIVERED CARE AND PAIN RELIEF IN TIMELY FASHION.,STAFFING LEVELS NOT ADEQUATE BUT CURRENT TIMES (COVID) DIDN'T HELP SO ASKING FOR A BLANKET WITHIN HOURS OF ADMISSION AND NEVER RECEIVING ONE BEFORE DISCHARGE WAS MY BIGGEST GRIPE. IF I HAD KNOWN WHERE THE LINEN CUPBOARD WAS I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN IT MYSELF BUT UNFORTUNATELY NURSING STAFF WERE PUSHED TO THE LIMIT AND WERE TOO BUSY TO ASK. I HAVE A HOSPITAL BAG PACKED FOR EMERGENCY ADMISSION SO HAVE INCLUDED A BLANKET IN IT SO I DON'T FREEZE IN FUTURE. WHY ARE BLANKETS NOT ON THE BED AT ALL TIMES? WHEN BEDS ARE MADE AFTER PATIENTS DISCHARGED ADD A BLANKET FOR NEXT ADMISSION. IT'S NOT ROCKET SCIENCE.

QESRRT, Cucumber Hospital,50+,Woman or female,Very good,THE BEST PART OF MY CARE WAS THE TREATMENT OF PAIN AFTER MY SURGERY.,WHAT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT IS THE TIME IT TAKES FOR NURSES TO ATTEND TO PATIENTS WHEN THEY BASED.

I ALSO SAW ONE OF THE TREATING DOCTORS FROM THE HOSPITAL IN HIM/HER PRIVATE ROOMS AND WAS ASKED IF I WAS UNWELL WHY WAS I DISCHARGED AND I ANSWERED THAT THE REGISTRAR DISCHARGED ME.

AND I THINK ALL THE OTHER NURSES FOUND THIS SENIOR PERSON QUITE DIFFICULT TO WORK WITH, AS WELL.  BUT OVERALL, I THOUGHT COMMUNICATIONS & NURSING CARE WITH ALL THE PERSONNEL AT THE XXXX HOSPITAL, WAS GENERALLY EXCELLENT.","UNFORTUNATELY, I SHARED A WARD WITH ANOTHER MAN/WOMAN, WHO WAS EXTREMELY OBESE & PHYSICALLY VERY LIMITED & PERHAPS BECAUSE OF THOSE FACTORS, THIS MAN/WOMAN ALSO SMELLED ABSOLUTELY APPALLINGLY, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE NURSES CHANGED HIM/HER SANITARY PADS OR BATHED HER. I COME FROM A FARM SO SMELLS USUALLY DON'T WORRY ME, BUT THE SHOCKING SMELL FROM THIS PATIENT WAS GUT WRENCHING!  SO I ASKED POLITELY IF I COULD PLEASE BE MOVED TO ANOTHER WARD, BECAUSE THE SMELL WAS MAKING ME FEEL VERY UNWELL. BUT I WAS TOLD THAT I COULD NOT BE MOVED TO ANOTHER WARD, EVEN THOUGH THERE WERE OBVIOUSLY SEVERAL OTHER UNOCCUPIED BEDS AVAILABLE. SO ON MANY OCCASIONS DURING MY STAY IN HOSPITAL, BECAUSE THE HORRENDOUS SMELL OF THE PATIENT WHO I WAS SHARING THE WARD WITH, MADE IT TOTALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO STAY IN THE SAME ROOM, WHENEVER HE/SHE WAS HAVING HIM/HER SANITARY PADS CHANGED OR HE/SHE WAS BEING SPONGED, SO I HAD TO STAY UP IN THE TV GUESTS ROOM & LIE DOWN ON THE COUCH IN THERE, UNTIL THE STENCH FINALLY CLEARED.

WHEN PATIENTS ARE IN PAIN AND HAVING TO WAIT FOR LONG PERIODS, MORE COMFORTABLE SEATING WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED. ESPECIALLY RELATED TO ARM RESTS, JUST A LITTLE CUSHIONING RATHER HARD METAL OR PLASTIC ON THE EDGES.   OTHERWISE JUST IN GENERAL THE HOSPITAL HAS AN AGEING STYLE AND DESIGN (INSIDE) WHICH EVEN THOUGH IT IN NO WAY REFLECTS THE QUALITY OF CARE, STILL MADE MY BRAIN FIND ANXIETIES AROUND DEVELOPING COMPLICATIONS AS A RESULT OF WHAT I WAS SEEING 'OLD AND DATED'. THIS WAS DEFINITELY NOT THE CASE, AND OF COURSE SOME OLD TECHNIQUES ARE STILL THE BEST, BUT A MORE MODERN LOOK TO THE PLACE (INSIDE) PROBABLY WOULD HELP WITH THOSE SPECIFIC CONCERNS.
